# Grid cartogram for Massachusetts cities & towns
Here's some Python code for visualizing all 351 municipalities in Massachusetts. Full disclosure, 1) I've been living in Massachusetts for almost 7 years, but 2) I'm from Arizona and am bad at geography, and 3) Some of these towns might be spatially kind of off. Let me know if they are!

The way it's made is that each town has a (x,y) coordinate in a figure of 32x22 subplots. I manually assigned each town to its location (hence the disclosure above).

If you use this in your work, feel free to let me know! I'd love to see this in action.
